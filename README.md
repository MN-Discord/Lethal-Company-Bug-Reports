Community ran Lethal Company bug report Github

HOW TO BUG REPORT: If the issue isn't very simple like a missing collision, include player.log file in (C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\LocalLow\ZeekerssRBLX\Lethal Company) with description of issue and what happened leading up to it. Even better: include player.log file from the host of the server if you are not the host. Videos are also immensely helpful. If you do all those things it basically ensures I can fix it.
